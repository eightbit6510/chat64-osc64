This document explains how to run the chat64 binary in the vice emulator and communicates with a real esp32 connected to it. This was tested in linux only.

On the esp32, the default usb serial bus is used to program the firmware and also run a monitoring console. A second usb to TTL converter like this one https://www.adafruit.com/product/954 has to be connected to the esp32 like this:

black wire : pin gnd
white wire : pin 17
green wire : pin 16

This second usb port is used to emulate access on the cartridge lines using a very simple serial based communication protocol.

The chat64 binary does not require any change. The firmware for the esp32 however needs to be compiled with the #define VICE_MODE. Just uncomment the proper line in the program, compile and flash your esp32

The support in vice is not merged in the official branch yet. You can pick up a copy from my local repository here:

git clone -b chat64 https://github.com/heneault/vice-mirror.git

To configure and compile vice refers to its building instruction for Linux. You need to install a bunch of dependency packages and install the required ROMs. 

To configure and compile I used the command :
cd vice
./configure --enable-gtk3ui
make

Before running it, first connect the esp32 default usb serial monitor. Flash it if necessary and open a serial monitor console on it. It should probably be identified as /dev/ttyUSB0

Then, connect the second usb serial port. In linux, it should be probably be detected as /dev/ttyUSB1

You can now start vice like this (from the vice/src folder):
./x64sc -rsdev1 /dev/ttyUSB1 -rsdev1baud 115200 -cartchat64 cartridge.bin

Adjust the path to the serial device or cartridge binary to your needs.

The application should start and communicate with the esp32!

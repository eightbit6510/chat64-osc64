**The Chat Cartridge for the Commodore64.**

A few years ago Bart had the idea to build a chat application for the Commodore 64.
After some revisions and hardware alterations a few cartridges were developed and spread amongst a small group of users. For a while nothing happened, also because of a server crash. Until Theo, who was one of the early testers of the project, reached out to Bart. Bart & Theo redesigned the hard- and software and rebuilt the webserver

At the moment there are a few boards being designed. A development board for development and testing purposes and two boards for general usage. One board consist of SMD components, but for those who want to build a cartridge themselves, but who do not feel comfortable soldering SMD components a THT version is designed.

New versions of the boards are being designed as a flaw was discovered, resulting in incompatible cartridges with some C64 hardware revisions. So please check out this repo frequently to check for changes.

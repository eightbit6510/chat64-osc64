Cartridge 3D files for Through Hole and SMD version.
Note: We found out that the current SMD cartridge version has a (to) tight fit in
the older high Breadbin C64. 
If you gave this version of the C64 you might want to edit and change 
the stl file a bit. Once we have an updated version we will publish
it here.
